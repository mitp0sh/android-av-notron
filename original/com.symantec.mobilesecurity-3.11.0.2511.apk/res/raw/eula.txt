You acknowledge that the Software and Services and related technical data and services (collectively "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported.  You agree to comply with all relevant laws and will not export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required.  All Symantec product is prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria and Sudan and to any country subject to relevant trade sanctions, including Afghanistan and Iraq.

11.  Arbitration: 

If You are a U.S. customer, You and Symantec agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Software and Services or this  License Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  You agree that, by agreeing to this License Agreement, the U.S.  Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that You and Symantec are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this License Agreement and/or the termination of Your Symantec product license.

If You elect to seek arbitration, You must first send to Symantec, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your claim ("Notice of Claim").  The Notice of Claim to Symantec should be addressed to: General Counsel, Symantec, Inc., 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043 and should be prominently captioned “NOTICE OF CLAIM”.   The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like Symantec to use to contact You.  If Symantec elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to Your billing address on file.  A Notice of Claim, whether sent by You or by Symantec, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand").  

If You and Symantec do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, You or Symantec may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.  You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.  If You are required to pay a filing fee, Symantec will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee after arbitration is commenced.  The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this License Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this License Agreement.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.  Unless Symantec and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either the mailing address You provided in Your Notice or, if no address was provided in Your Notice, Your billing address on file.  If Your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, Symantec agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If Your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  If the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of Symantec’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Symantec did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Symantec will pay You, in addition to the award, either U.S. $500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

YOU AND SYMANTEC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both You and Symantec agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with Your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

12. General:

This License Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America. This License Agreement is the entire agreement between You and Symantec relating to the Software and Services and:  (i) supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to its subject matter; and (ii) prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or similar communications between the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this License Agreement will diminish any rights You may have under existing consumer protection legislation or other applicable laws in Your jurisdiction that may not be waived by contract. Symantec may terminate this License Agreement if You breach any term contained in this License Agreement (other than a trivial or inconsequential breach) and, if such termination occurs, You must cease use of and destroy all copies of the Software and Services and Documentation.  The disclaimers of warranties and damages and limitations on liability shall survive and continue to apply after termination.    Should You have any questions concerning this License Agreement, or if You desire to contact Symantec for any reason, please write to Symantec Customer Service, 555 International Way, Springfield, OR 97477, U.S.A. or visit the Symantec Support page at www.symantec.com.
